1.1 - Mastery Learning
::::::::::::::::::::::

Before we begin this computer graphics textbook, let's discuss
the basic learning philosophy on which it is based.

In a traditional education system, all students work through material at the same
pace and then take an exam. A student's score on the exam is hopefully a reflection
of how much the student has learned. In any case, the student is expected to
go on to the next topic's material, even if they have large gaps in understanding
of the material they were just tested on. This lack of understanding of fundamental knowledge
makes learning higher level concepts very challenging and in some cases impossible.
Is there a better approach? Consider "mastery learning."

.. admonition:: Definition

  `Mastery learning`_ maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery
  (e.g., 100% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving
  forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve
  mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and
  reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues
  until the learner accomplishes mastery. Upon mastery a student can move
  on to more complex topics.

Casual observation tells you that students learn at different speeds. So why don't
we allow enough time for each individual student to master a topic before
asking them to tackle harder topics? It's simple -- one teacher can't provide
individual instruction to a group of students. If the teacher is the source
of learning, whatever the teacher is "teaching" is what a student is "learning."
What is needed is a way for each student to learn different material at their
own pace. What is needed is an interactive textbook like this one.

However, a self-paced, instructional textbook is not enough. We are terrible
at discerning how much we understand! We often think we understand something, when
in reality, we don't understand the first thing about it.
*Mastery learning* requires assessment. A student needs
concrete ways to determine they have "mastered" a topic. Assessments could
be done by a teacher, but the burden of constant assessments prevents the
teacher from mentoring students who need help. Ideally self-assessment is needed.
Self-assessment is, by far, the hardest thing to provide a self-paced student.
This requires automated testing, which,
in many cases, devolves into multiple choice questions that can be graded by a computer.
The critical aspect of *mastery learning* is that a student does not study higher
level topics until they are ready. So the burden of learning is on the student
and it requires a student to understand when they are ready to tackle the next topic.

Therefore ...
-------------

This interactive textbook provides a self-paced learning environment for a
student to use *mastery learning* to understand computer graphics. Computer
Graphics is a complex topic that requires a combination of many skills. It
is up to the student to master the fundamentals before moving on to harder
topics.

This interactive textbook provides three critical pieces of self-paced learning:

* Detailed explanations of how computer graphics produces 3D interactive images.
* Opportunities to experiment and directly work with computer graphics concepts.
* Assessment tools for a student to determine if they are ready to move on to higher level topics.

In the ideal case a student would have a teacher or mentor to lead them
through this textbook. If you don't have a teacher, try to get a friend to
study the material with you. But whatever situation you are in,
**don't gloss over the self-assessments**. The assessments will help you
understand how much you are
actually learning and which parts of the material you need to re-study.
As a student you need to re-think what it means to learn and you must break your
old habits of just ignoring things you don't understand. If you don't
understand something, study it again (and again) until you do understand it!

This textbook is designed to be self-directed and self-paced. You
are encouraged to stay with a topic until you understand it at more
than a surface level. If you "master" each topic before going to the
next topic, you will be prepared for the more detailed topics that
follow. If you proceed past a lesson you don't understand, you will
quickly get bogged down and frustrated. Take a pace that suits your
learning style and abilities. If you do, your learning will be more enjoyable
and the things you learn will have a longer impact on your future abilities.

Self-Assessments
----------------

.. mchoice:: 1.1.1
  :random:
  :answer_a: It forces every student to learn at the same pace. More advanced students get bored. Less advanced students struggle.
  :answer_b: It continues with new material even when students don't fully understand the current material.
  :answer_c: It is old and needs updating.
  :answer_d: It assumes that gaining 70% understanding of a topic is good enough.
  :correct: a,b,d
  :feedback_a: Going at an "average" pace is OK for some students, but it hinders the advanced and struggling students.
  :feedback_b: Gaps in knowledge can prevent a student from understanding more advanced material.
  :feedback_c: Just because something if old doesn't mean it needs to be replaced.
  :feedback_d: If a student understands 70% of a topic, there is still 30% they don't understand. This causes problems when trying to learn more advanced topics.

.. parsonsprob:: 1.1.2
  :noindent:
  :adaptive:

  Please correctly order the following steps to mastery learning.
  -----
  Study a topic.
  =====
  Perform an assessment of how much you understand about the topic.
  =====
  If not 100% on the assessment, go back to step 1 and re-study the material.
  =====
  If 100% on the assessment, begin study of a new topic.
  =====

.. mchoice:: 1.1.3
  :random:
  :answer_a: You can skip the self-assessments at the end of a lesson because you understood all of the concepts on the first reading.
  :answer_b: Re-studying a lesson when you miss questions on assessments will keep you from being frustrated on more advanced topics.
  :answer_c: You can skip the interactive examples. They don't really add much to your learning.
  :answer_d: Performing the self-assessments at the end of each lesson is critical to your learning.
  :correct: b,d
  :feedback_a: This is possible, but very unlikely.
  :feedback_b: When you don't fully understand something, your gaps in knowledge will hinder you when studying more advanced topics.
  :feedback_c: Not true! Only when you engage with the interactive examples will you learn how WebGL actually works.
  :feedback_d: Without assessment, you can be self-delusional and think you understand concepts when you really don't.
